## notes

A to do list, things to check, and other random information (even if a low/no priority).

* do [Reproducuble builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/)

* checks for elf hardening options like [relo](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/hardening-elf-binaries-using-relocation-read-only-relro), [PIC](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/Position_Independent_Code_internals), and [PIE](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/PIE)

* play with some [Fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing), learn about fuzzing and see if anything falls out of MPD

* addresssanitizer builds ([ASan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer)) for dev/test deploys?
